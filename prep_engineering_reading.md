# Prep - Engineering Reading

**Date Due:** March 18, 11:59pm PDT

The ability to think and act like an engineer is an important step in actually becoming one. Successful
engineers share specific traits, including the ability to problem-solve in a meaningful way, so
recalibrating how one thinks in the direction of a more problem-solving personality helps immensely in
replicating that success. Successful habits lead to successful outcomes.

## Discussion Questions

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I bring a unique perspective and a breadth of experience that few others could match. In my years in the business world, I have
worked with companies large and small, for private industry and for government entities. I have worked at places with as few as
three employees and for companies with thousands. I have learned to work alone and in teams and have used each experience to
grow, learn new strategies, and apply that learning to all areas of my life.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Try to break down the problem into smaller chunks, then try solving for the easier, smaller "sub-problems."
2. Take a break from the problem. Get up from the computer, grab a snack, take my mind off the issue. Letting the brain ruminate while working on something else solves lots of issues.
3. Look for potential approaches that have been successful in other, similar problems. Chat GPT, Google, and Stack Overflow are full of potential solutions to similar issues. Take the time to research solutions, and the time to truly understand why suggested approaches may or may not work in a particular situation.

## Things I would like to know more about

- Look to successful developers I already know and find out from them what approaches they use in their everyday problem-solving.
- How can I find some great examples of "gamifying" problem solving in everyday life, as discussed in the _Super Mario Effect_ video?
- What are some good strategies for making sure that I am able to set boundaries for my time and not say "yes" to everything that is asked of me?
