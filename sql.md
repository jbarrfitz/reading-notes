# Prep - SQL Practice

**Date Due:** March 18, 11:59pm PDT

Relational databases contain tables that are connected to each other through shared fields, referred to as
keys. A primary key is one whose value is unique within a table which identifies that particular row in the
table. When that primary key is referred to in another table, that key is referred to as a foreign key.

These keys can be used to join the tables together using Structured Query Language (SQL). Using SQL, one can
query the database using fields from multiple tables and consolidate, group, and sort that data into meaningful
results for the user. SQL is a standardized language that most relational databases use, although many individual
databases have slight variances in the standard. A standard SQL query includes several clauses including:

- SELECT: where a user can list the fields that they wish to retrieve.
- FROM: the table from which the data is to be retrived. In conjunction with a JOIN clause, multiple tables can be specified.
- WHERE: criteria that limits which records are to be retrieved
- GROUP BY: which specifies the fields under which any aggregate data can be grouped
- HAVING: criteria that limits which group records are to be returned
- ORDER BY: the sort order of the final, resulting query
- LIMIT: which limits the returned records to a specific number or percentage of all records.

## Things I would like to know more about

- How often is SQL used in web development, given the proliferation of NoSQL databases.
- What are the cases for using SQL over NoSQL in a project?
