This is a collection of notes taken from reading assignments presented during
Class 401 (_Advanced Software Development in Python_) with [Code Fellows](https://codefellows.org). This
will serve as a repository for knowledge gained and resources linked throughout
the course and will be a valuable resource when needing to research these topics.
