## Reading Questions

### What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

The key benefit of using a Django Custom User Model is flexibility. When a custom model is used, it becomes much
more simple to make changes to that user model later. While initial needs of the project may be met by using
the default user model, making changes later is very time- and labor-intensive, so it is strongly recommended
that all projects begin with the user of a Custom User Model, even if it does not differ from the default model.
