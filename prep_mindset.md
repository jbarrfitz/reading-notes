Successful people who excel at a particular craft are in many cases those who participate in "deliberate practice." These people are those
who choose to challenge themselves. In the software development world, that entails not just coding on a daily basis, but actually
challenging yourself to learn new techniques and methods and ways of accomplishing tasks that are outside the scope of normal work. This ensures
that constant learning is happening, rather than stagnating by repeating the same few tasks.

Much research has been done on the topic of "grit," or the ability to stick with a task or project no matter how difficult it gets. People
who exhibit this trait have been found to be much more successful at completing whatever goal they are striving toward, and research shows
that it can matter more than many other commonly-cited traits such as intelligence or socioeconomic status. Developing this trait can be
invaluable whenever a new, challenging issues comes along in someone's life.

Success can be measured in many different ways, but in our modern Western society, it often is directly correlated with job or financial success.
Redefining success means taking a step back in realizing that there are inherent inequalities in these systems, and that success in these arenas
is usually something that rerquires sheer luck or happenstance. Understanding that people come from different backgrounds and have different life
experiences helps us to reframe what is meant by success. Success can and should look different to every individual, so to envy someone for their
perceived success in one area of life is generally counterproductive.

In assessing my emotional intelligence, I tend to score quite highly among all the areas. although self-management is still an area in which I
could use some improvement. In bias assessment, my weakest area is definitely effective courage. I see that there are times that I should be able
to use my voice to more effectively stand up for others.

## Things I would like to know more about

- Look to successful developers I already know and find out from them what approaches they use in their everyday problem-solving.
- How can I find some great examples of "gamifying" problem solving in everyday life, as discussed in the _Super Mario Effect_ video?
- What are some good strategies for making sure that I am able to set boundaries for my time and not say "yes" to everything that is asked of me?
